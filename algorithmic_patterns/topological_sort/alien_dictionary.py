"""
There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the characters.
Write a method to find the correct order of characters in the alien language.

Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
Output: bac

Explanation:
Each word in the word list specify some ordering. In the above example, a comes after b, c comes after b,
c comes after a; then by the principle of transitivity, the order is b > a > c

Construct the edges of the graph based on the rules laid down by the words then apply topological sort
